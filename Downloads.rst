This spreadsheet is a sophisticated tool for monitoring the performance of your liquidity pools. You can add positions in each pool, estimate liquidity rewards and volume rewards and estimate a good time to leave the pools, so that you don't suffer from impermanent loss. Usage instructions to follow, but it it quite intuitive, so download it, open it and fill in the yellow boxes with data from the exchange. To summarize :-

1. Update the latest pool data in the "pool data" tab for it to be up to date

2. Enter your current pooled FSN (not entry FSN) in the "your pooling" tab to get estimates of rewards for the day & APY etc.

3. You can enter your entry prices/values in the "impermanent loss" tab to calculate current profit/loss (excluding rewards) if you wish

4. The "Basic_Pool Stats" will tell you a brief summary of pool rewards and what ANY you get per 100 fsn pooled

5. The other tabs are some graphical data on what happens if the price changes

This spreadsheet allows you to estimate the trading and liquidity provision rewards from each of the Anyswap pools in a quick and dirty fashion. It is much simpler than the first, less powerful, but shows easily how the numbers are calculated. With more pairs coming, it will become unfeasible to maintain this spreadsheet and it will be removed in the future.
