<h1>Some General Questions about Anyswap<a class="headerlink" href="#some-general-questions-about-anyswap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Who are the Anyswap management team?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>They are drawn from the Fusion Foundation. The acting CEO is Zhaojun He and DJ Qian is very active in the team.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Where is the Anyswap website?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>This is being compiled now and will be released shortly. In the meantime we encourage you to simply use the exchange.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Where is the White Paper of Anyswap?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>There is no White Paper, since the Anyswap DEX is fully functioning and Anyswap are not looking for funding.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="what-is-anyswap-dex">
<h2>What is Anyswap DEX?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-anyswap-dex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What Features will Anyswap provide?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Decentralized Cross Chain Bridge — Users can deposit any coins into the protocol and mint wrapped tokens in a decentralized way.</li>
<li>Cross Chain Swaps — Users can immediately swap from one coin to another.</li>
<li>Programmed Pricing and Liquidity — Liquidity provider could add and withdraw liquidity into swap pair. The programmed pricing system is based on the liquidity provided.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What is a DEX?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>A Decentralized EXchange allows the exchange of value between two or more assets, without the need to send those assets to a Centralized EXchange (CEX) first. When assets are sent to a CEX, they are no longer in your possession. You do not have the Private Key to the assets on a CEX and so you do not actually own them (just like you do not own the money in your FIAT bank). With Anyswap, your assets only leave your wallet, when they are secure under the control of a Smart Contract, since you alone know your complete Private Key.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What pairs are available on the Anyswap DEX?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>The exchange supports different pairs on each of its supported blockchains Fusion, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom and Ethereum. Until version 2 of Anyswap is here, all pairings will be with the base coin of the blockchain :- FSN, FTM, BNB or ETH. Users can swap between any two assets such as between ANY and aUSDT, or aETH and aUSDT as well as the base coins. In these cases, the fees will apply twice (i.e. 2 x 0.4%).</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What are the fees for using the exchange?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Users pay the gas fee, (which is typically very low on Fusion, Fantom and Binance Smart Chain, but high on Ethereum). In addition users pay 0.4% of the sum being transferred. Of this 0.3% goes directly to Liquidity Providers and 0.1% goes to Anyswap.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>How does Anyswap work without knowing my Private Key?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>This is one of the most important aspects of a trustless DEX. Anyswap uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://fusion.org">Fusion</a>  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fsn-dev/dcrm-sdk">DCRM</a> technology. With DCRM, your Private Key is ‘sharded’, or split up with each piece being managed by a different node on the network. To make an exchange of value, a transaction must be signed by each of these nodes, but the important part is that the PRIVATE KEY IS NEVER ASSEMBLED and so the transaction cannot happen without all of these nodes colluding. This is the safest non-custodial way of sending assets. When you want to make an exchange of value on Anyswap, you must either authorize the transaction using MetaMask, or a hardware device like a Ledger connected to your wallet.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Why is it important that Anyswap’s Smart Contract, Cross Chain Bridge and DCRM are Open Source?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fsn-dev/anyswap">Anyswap Smart Contract</a> , the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fsn-dev/crossChain-Bridge">Cross Chain Bridge</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fsn-dev/dcrm-sdk">DCRM</a> source code can be examined and the applications can be re-created by anyone with a little programming knowledge. In this way users are assured that the code is indeed decentralized and that there are no back doors into the code, or any malicious code that could steal your data or assets. In fact IF THE DEX CODE IS NOT OPEN SOURCE, IT IS NOT DECENTRALIZED. Open Source code can be modified or copied by anyone (providing they comply with the licenses). This is important since the code can evolve and improve and cannot become stranded due to someone dying, or refusing or being unable to continue code development.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Are Anyswap’s smart contracts audited?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Yes. All new chains are audited by the company Slow Mist before going live. Here is the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/anyswap/Anyswap-Audit/find/master">audit of Anyswap</a></li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What is a Cross Chain DEX?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Anyswap is the first true Cross Chain DEX. With Anyswap you can exchange tokens or coins between any blockchains supporting the ECDSA or EdDSA cryptographic algorithm. This includes more than 95% of all chains, including ETH, BTC, XRP, XMR, XLM, LTC, TRX, XTZ, BCH, BSV, EOS, ADA etc. It also includes any tokens on these chains like ERC20’s. Since Anyswap uses <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fsn-dev/dcrm-sdk">DCRM</a> it does not require any code chnages to be made on any of the blockchains. In this respect it is superior to COSMOS or Polkadot, which we regard as being a ‘compatibility’ standard. DCRM is truly an ‘inter-operability’ standard.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Why are Fusion, Fantom and Binance Smart Chain’s addresses the same as Ethereum’s?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>These blockchains were all forked from Ethereum and kept its address format. If you send Fusion’s coin FSN, or tokens on Fusion like ANY to an Ethereum address, you will not see them in an Ethereum wallet like Trustwallet, ot MyEtherWallet because they use a different blockchain (and blockchain ID). YOU HAVE NOT LOST YOUR assets though, since you can simply open a Fusion wallet using the same Private Key, wallet file + password, or hardware wallet (using the ETH extension) and you will see your assets there. The same applies to assets on the other blockchains Fantom and Binance Smart Chain.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Is the bridge for assets onto Anyswap decentralized?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>For now the answer is ‘partially’, since the Bridge is controlled by 5 DCRM nodes run by either Anyswap (at different locations), or their auditors Slow Mist. After the election of the Anyswap Working Nodes (AWN’s) by ANY token holders at the end of 2020, we can say that the Bridge of assets into the Anyswap smart contract will be decentralized. There will be at least 5 AWN’s (maybe many more, with testing of 11 nodes currently taking place) added to the DCRM nodes run by Anyswap and these AWN’s can be replaced by votes of ANY token holders.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tokens and coin pairs supported by Anyswap<a class="headerlink" href="#tokens-and-coin-pairs-supported-by-anyswap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What coins and tokens will be supported by Anyswap in the short term?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>There are now many pairs on each of the Anyswap exchanges. Please see the exchange itself to see them.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What coins and tokens will be supported by Anyswap eventually?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>This is to be decided by ANY voting for each pair.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Can Anyswap support ERC-20 tokens?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Yes. Anyswap will support all ERC20’s</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Why not list tokens and coins quickly?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Each new blockchain will be audited by Slow Mist before being eligible for listing on the exchange. Another reason to move more slowly is that it is essential that sufficient liquidity be available to support each pair. This will require a discussion with each blockchain community, exchanges, or other parties.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Can I list my company’s token on Anyswap?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Please contact Anyswap to discuss this. Listing decisions are made by voting using the Governance mechanism. See the description in this wiki ‘How to Vote on Anyswap’. Anyone with 1000 ANY or in liquidity in their Fusion wallet can propose a vote on a listing. When making a proposal, please include these details :-</li>
</ol>
<p>Name, ERC20 contract address if appropriate, the desired Anyswap exchange to list on, the source chain and the target chain.</p>
<p>Here is an example :-</p>
<p>Name: LINK（ChainLink）</p>
<p>ERC20 Address: 0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca</p>
<p>From Chain: Ethereum</p>
<p>To Chain: Binance Smart Chain</p>
<p>Project Info:
The content of the proposal will be supported by the Cross-Chain Bridge after technical evaluation and voting.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Can anyone simply create a pair on Anyswap?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Yes, but the support of ANY holders will be required to make the listing visible on the exchange and for it to attract ANY liquidity rewards. The precise rules will be decided by voting and will likely result in a balance between ease of listing and avoidance of scam token listings as we see on other DEX’s. There may be a lower limit on the amount of liquidity before a pair will earn ANY liquidity rewards.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Who is currently providing liquidity for Anyswap?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Ordinary liquidity providers, as well as Hotbit. Further liquidity will be provided by other entities in due course.</li>

<div class="section" id="wallets-supported-by-anyswap">
<h2>Wallets supported by Anyswap<a class="headerlink" href="#wallets-supported-by-anyswap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What wallets does Fusion and Anyswap support?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>We recommend that you use the Fusion Open Source Community (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fsn-dev">FOSC</a>) wallet called <a class="reference external" href="https://whallet.net">whallet.net</a> It will receive some significant cross chain enhancements in the very near future. Whallet is open source ( see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fsn-dev/whallet-web">Whallet github</a> ) and considered safe by the Fusion Foundation. Whallet works well with a hardware wallet such as a Ledger and we recommend that you use one.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also use your Ethereum address, for instance from your Trust Wallet, or MEW. You will not see your Ethereum assets on Anyswap, except for those which you will bridging to Fusion - ETH or ERC-20’s.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>If I want to connect my Ledger, what app should I use?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Use the Ethereum Ledger app. It is compatible with the Fusion blockchain.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>I’m trying to connect using MetaMask but I can’t see my balances</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Most likely you have not set up the custom blockchain settings. Ethereum will only work for the Ethereum version of Anyswap. The correct MetaMask settings can be found on the wiki under the relevant blockchain setup. See ‘How to Setup and Use Anyswap’.</li>

<h2>How does Anyswap Work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-anyswap-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><br></p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Anyswap_Architecture.png"><img alt="_images/Anyswap_Architecture.png" src="_images/Anyswap_Architecture.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p><br></p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>How does a liquidity pool work?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha">
<li><p class="first">Anyswap uses the “Constant Product Market Maker Model.” If you have a pair on the exchange, then to enter the pool you have to match the USD value of a token, say aToken, with FSN. Let’s suppose that you need A aTokens and F FSN (or ETH, FTM, BNB etc.) to do this. The way the pool works is that when you multiply A and F, the result is constant :-</p>
<p>A * F = C</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is true, except for the fact that when trades are made, 0.3% of the trade is added to the Liquidity Pool (LP) and so in reality C grows slowly, but let’s ignore this for now. When someone buys aTokens, your proportion of the pool’s aTokens also decreases and so does A. To compensate, F increases. The same happens vice-versa - if someone sells aTokens for FSN to the pool, your A increases and your F decreases.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Why does the price of the asset paired with FSN (or ETH, FTM, BNB etc.) change?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>The price is the FSN (or ETH, FTM, BNB) liquidity total value divided by the token liquidity total value. This can change dramatically if someone makes a large swap from a small pool, allowing good arbitrage opportunities for quick traders.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What is ‘slippage’ and how can I control it?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Slippage is the change from the displayed swap rate when a swap is actually made. If there is not much liquidity in a pool, or the trade is large, then this can be significant. The default slippage value is 0.5%, but you can control this by clicking ‘Advanced Deatils’ below the swap and then setting your own allowable slippage percentage value. If there is not enough liquidity to accommodate your swap, then the swap will fail (small wheel at the top right stops spinning, without the balances changing). There will be no error displayed, instead you either try again, or change the slippage value. Alternatively you can change the time to wait by changing the ‘set swap deadline’ value.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What is ‘impermanent loss’ and how can I lose money in a liquidity pool?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>When someone buys an asset from a pool, they are effectively buying from one half of your liquidity pair - in proportion to your pool percentage stake. This means that the price of that asset will go up and the price of the other asset in the pair will go down. To maintain the ‘constant product’, this can lead to ‘impermanent loss’, since you will be gaining a less valuable asset and losing a more valuable one. In extremis, if the price ratio chnages a lot, you would lose money if you cashed out at that point. BUT this is an ‘impermanant loss’, since if you wait until the price ratio returns to the value you entered at, then the loss will evaporate. The ideal situation for a yield farmer is if both assets stay at roughly the same price ratio, but there is a lot of volume and volatility to generate fees.</li>

<div class="section" id="what-is-any-the-native-token-of-anyswap">
<h2>What is ANY, the native token of Anyswap?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-any-the-native-token-of-anyswap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What is the ANY token?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>The ANY token is a governance token on the Fusion blockchain. It’s only purpose at the moment is to allow the election of Anyswap Working Nodes (AWN’s), which will take place in late 2020 and to vote on new coin or token listings on anyswap.exchange. ANY’s are awarded for using the anyswap.exchange platform and for other community rewards and incentives for various aspects of the platform.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Is ANY an ERC-20 Token?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>ANY originates as a token on the Fusion blockchain. It is a smart contract on each of the supported blockchains.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Can I see ANY in Trustwallet?</li>
</ol>
<p>A. Yes if you are on Anyswap Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. For Fusion, you have to use a Fusion wallet like <a class="reference external" href="https://whallet.net">whallet.net</a> or
pwawallet.fantom.network for Fantom.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Can I send ERC-20 tokens to anyswap.exchange?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>You can see your ERC20’s on the Ethereum Anyswap exchange, but on the other chains you have to use the Bridge to convert them to smart contracts on the respective chain. Not all ERC20’s can be bridged, only those that are supported.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>How do I send ANY tokens, or other Bridged assets like aUSDT to another wallet?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Use <a class="reference external" href="https://whallet.net">whallet.net</a> or you can use the Bridge in the exchange. Ther is also another finction called ‘Swap Send’, which enables you to both swap and send to another wallet in one operation. This can be found under the Swap tab.</li>

</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">

<h2>How does Anyswap reward stakers, traders and liquidity providers?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-anyswap-reward-stakers-traders-and-liquidity-providers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>How does Anyswap reward stakers?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Anyswap allows ANY on the Fusion platform to be staked. Users can click on ‘Staking’ on the Fusion platform and they once they have unlocked the smart contract (only required to be done once), they can then add to their stake by clicking the + button. Rewards continuosly update, visible on the display and can be harvested at any time. The staked ANY can be unstaked at any time. If you add more to your stake, the outstanding rewards are put back into your wallet. The APY from staking is shown in the display and depends on how many ANY are currently staked by everyone.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What rewards do traders receive?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Anyswap has differentiated itself from other DEX’s by rewarding trading directly. On the Fusion blockchain version of Anyswap, every 100 blocks (~ 20 minutes), ANY are awarded to traders, split according to their proportion of the volume in this period. If a user is the only one making a trade within these 100 blocks, they would receive all of the ANY. If there is no swap trade during this 100 blocks (very unlikely), the rewards will be split between liquidity providers and Anyswap Working Node (AWN) runners.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What fixed rewards do Liquidity Providers receive?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Liquidity rewards are split between the different blockchains of Anyswap. Every approximately 24 hours, ANY will be rewarded to liquidity providers according to each one’s liquidity portion, The system will use the lowest liquidity provided by each providers to calculate the portion. Before AWN’s are elected, the 6,600 that will eventually go to the AWN’s will go to liquidity providers.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>How are the fixed liquidity rewards distributed between each pool?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>The rewards are split between pools and are weighted, with some pairs receiving twice of three times the lowest rewarded pairs. The ANY liquidity rewards are shown to the right of the dashboard as APY (Annual Percentage Yield) values. These values take into account the total allocation of ANY to each blockchain. An example of the allocation can be seen here for the Binance Smart Chain :-</li>
</ol>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/BSC_APY.png"><img alt="_images/BSC_APY.png" src="_images/BSC_APY.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What volume based rewards do liquidity providers receive?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>In addition to the fixed ANY rewards, liquidity providers also receive volume based rewards. Every time a trade is made, 0.3% of the trade value is added to the liquidity pool (split between both members of the pair). The liquidity provider will receive their proportion of this reward added to their stake. This happens every 100 blocks.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>Is the reward structure fixed for all time?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>No. Rewards can be changed using the governance function of ANY through voting.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>How can I see the trading rewards?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>These are added to the your pool according to your percentage of that pool. If you multiply the number of e.g. FSN by the number of the other pair, you will see that this product increases as trading happens. You can calculate the dollar value of your pool contribution by multiplying the number of FSN by two and then multiplying it by the price of FSN. If the price of both assets in your pair decreases, so too will the total value of your pool allocation.</li>

<li>What are the charges for bridging assets onto Anyswap?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>There are no charges other than gas fees, which are covered by the gateway fee when users bridge out their assets. Users do not need to have gas in their wallets to bridge assets onto the platform.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>What are the charges for bridging assets off from the exchange?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>A 0.1% gateway fee will be charged to users who use bridge to lock out wrapped assets. Users do not need to have gas on the target blockchain, since this is covered by the fee.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>How long does it take to bridge assets onto and off from the exchange?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>This depends on how big the transaction is. For most transactions, in the case of ETH, ERC-20’s or BTC, it will take less than 30 minutes. One hour is quite possible though. For large asset exchanges it may take up to 24 hours to bridge. This depends upon the dynamics of the target blockchain.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="17">
<li>How can I track the bridging process?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Please use the respective block explorers for the blockchain in question. fsnex.com for Fusion, bscscan.com BSC, etherscan.io for Ethereum and explorer.fantom.network for the Fantom network. Users can also keep an eye on the target blockchain explorers, where their assets will end up.</li>
